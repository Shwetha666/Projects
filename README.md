Recession Analysis.

Introduction
Recession is calculated and analyzed according to the growth in GDP, the growth in the unemployment rate, and the growth in consumer spending rate. But the most common way of measuring recession is by analyzing the monthly GDP growth data. So, for the task of Recession analysis, we need to have a dataset of the monthly GDP growth of a country. I found an ideal dataset for this task that is based on the monthly GDP growth rate of the United Kingdom. 

Steps for Recession Analysis
•	Import Libraries: Load necessary libraries like Pandas and Plotly.
•	Load Data: Import the GDP growth data from `UK_monthly_gdp.csv`.
•	Visualize Monthly GDP: Create a heatmap to show GDP growth over time.
•	Convert to Quarterly Data: Resample the data to convert it from monthly to quarterly.
•	Identify Recession Periods: Define recessions as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and mark them.
•	Plot GDP and Recessions: Visualize GDP growth and highlight recession periods.
•	Analyze Recession Metrics: Calculate and plot the duration and severity of each recession period.

Data Collection
For this recession analysis project, data was collected from reliable economic and financial sources, focusing on the UK economy. The primary dataset, UK_monthly_gdp.csv, includes monthly GDP data. Additional macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment rates and inflation, were sourced to provide a comprehensive view of economic conditions. Data was gathered in a consistent format suitable for analysis and modelling.

Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the economic trends and potential indicators of a recession in the UK. By analyzing monthly GDP data and other key economic indicators,we identified significant patterns and trends that can help forecast economic downturns. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring these indicators to inform policy decisions and prepare for future economic challenges.The analysis and visualizations offer a clear and concise understanding of the current economic landscape, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
